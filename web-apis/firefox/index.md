### How Do I Contribute Code?

### Firefox Implementation Details

`getUserMedia`, `PeerConnection` and `DataChannels` are implemented in the
desktop version of Firefox for Windows, Linux and Mac. `getUserMedia` does not
require any flags to use in Firefox 20 or later. `PeerConnection` and
`DataChannels` do not require a flag for Firefox Nightly versions after
February 19, 2013.

Here are some frequently asked questions about the current implementation:


#### DataChannels

Supported in Firefox today, you can use `DataChannels` to send peer-to-peer
information during an audio/video call.


#### TURN

We donâ€™t have TURN support yet, but we plan to support it soon.


#### Opus

We support the [Opus audio codec][6] as our preferred audio codec. We also
support G.711 for compatibility with devices that have not yet implemented
Opus.


#### Recording API

We have not implemented the [Recording API][7] yet, but we plan to support it
in future versions of Firefox.
