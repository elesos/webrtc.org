Today, we are making available WebRTC, an open technology for voice and video
on the web. With WebRTC, we'd like to make the browser the home for innovation
in real time communications.

Until now, real time communications required the use of proprietary signal
processing technology that was mostly delivered through plug-ins and client
downloads. With WebRTC, we are open sourcing the voice and video engine
technologies from our acquisition of GIPS, giving developers access to state
of the art signal processing technology, under a royalty free BSD style
license. This will allow developers to create voice and video chat
applications via simple HTML and JavaScript APIs.

In this effort, we'll be working closely with other browser developers such as
Mozilla and Opera, to implement this technology for use by the broader web
community.  In addition, we've collectively engaged with the standards
communities such as IETF and W3C working groups to define and implement a set
of standards for real time communications.

We expect more innovations in the coming months by various community members
and we will continue to develop key technologies and features that enable
open, real time communications on the web.

A developer preview of WebRTC including source code, specs and tools is
available now at [code.webrtc.org](http://code.webrtc.org/).
