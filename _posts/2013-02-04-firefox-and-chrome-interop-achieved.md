Today, [Chrome] and [Firefox] jointly announced interoperability for WebRTC.
This website has been updated with information for developers wanting to build
interoperable web apps.

  1. We've added a Firefox section that lists status and useful resources.

  2. We've added a Demo section that details how interop is achieved through
     running code.

  3. We'e added a Interop Notes section which call out the main differences.

We'll keep the site updated as changes are expected to be frequent.

Thanks!
