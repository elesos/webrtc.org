WebRTC is now live in Chrome version 23, which is now rolling out to the
public. No flag needed, no special Chrome build required.

It's the biggest milestone yet. Our journey started with the open sourcing of
key technologies in June 2011 and with the help of community driven workgroups
at the [W3C][1] and [IETF][2], we made these technologies available through a
web API and ensured standardized protocols. We also iterated heavily based on
your feedback.

18 short months later, web developers can now offer Chrome users the ability
to have live, high quality audio and video communication as part of their web
experience.

If you are a developer, [join our mailing list][3] and take a look at [some
demos][4] and start thinking today how letting people talk and see each other
could change how they experience your services / applications!
