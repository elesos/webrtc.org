First big milestone. All stable Chrome users will autoupdate automatically to
version 21 which contains getUserMedia. This means that great apps such as
[Paul Neave's Webcam toy][1] and the [amazing xylophone][2] now work for users
all over the world without any flags or without requiring any special version
of Chrome. It's for real this time.

For web developers wishing to deploy this to IE users, I am happy to report
that the feature works great with [Chrome Frame][3].

For more details, check out the [Chrome blog post][4], the
[Chromium Blog post][5] and the [W3C getUserMedia API][6].
