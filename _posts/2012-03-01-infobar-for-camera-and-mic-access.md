From today's canary (19.0.1057) we have added a user consent UI for a web page
to access input devices such as camera and microphones. Currently this works
on Windows only, Linux and Mac support is on its way. Privacy and security are
very important topics for WebRTC, and exactly how this should be handled is
discussed a lot in w3c and IETF, so expect changes going forward.
