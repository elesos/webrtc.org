### AppRTC

[appr.tc](https://appr.tc) is a webrtc demo application hosted on App Engine.

Developed by Google and Mozilla, it enables both browsers to "talk" to each
other using the WebRTC API.

</div>

To try this yourself youâ€™ll need
[Firefox](https://nightly.mozilla.org/), and
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) on desktop or
[Chrome on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en).

The source code can be found here:
<https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc>.

Interop between both browsers is a snap thanks to a Javascript adapter
library. Source code can be found here:
<https://github.com/webrtc/adapter>

To read more about cross browser compatibility, please consult our
[browser interop page]({{ site.baseurl }}/web-apis/interop/).
